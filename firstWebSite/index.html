    <p>I might be new to web development, but I've learned a lot so far.</p>
    <h3>GitHub</h3>
    <p>I've learned to manage code in repositories on GitHub.  This allows me to be able to work on my projects anywhere.  No more worries about losing a portable drive!</p>
    <h3>Basic HTML</h3>
    <p>I've also learned to write some of the most common HTML tags, and to write HTML for structure not appearance.  Some of the tags that I've learned include headings &#40;&#60;h1&#62;&#60;h2&#62;&#60;h3&#62;, etc.&#41;, paragraphs, and lists.  I've also learned to use special entity characters.</p>
